**Reporter**:

My first question is for Mr. BA intersections.
How quickly can these companies get to hospitals and clinic ks to deal with the expected surge.
Have you given these companies a timeline of when it needs to be out there?



As soon as possible is a short answer.
We recognize that this isn't the only measure we have in place.
As My colleague Anita mentioned, she is identifying the unique needs and requirements working in close consultation with the public health agency of Canada.
We're coordinating with the provincial and territorial counterparts to understand the needs and these needs are evolving and changing rapidly as you can fully appreciate.
What I'm focused on is to say that we want to be overprepared.
We want to take all the additional measures that we possibly can and one of the ways to do that is to build domestic capacity and mobilizing our industry to do so. a letter of intent with the three companies that are highlighted today demonstrate that they're willing to scale in some cases and also start production as well.
and in some cases a matter of weeks and months and these trnl only companies.
I can assure you.
There's many, many companies that have expressed interest.
That's why we're launching the website in that portal today to deal with other companies so they can also provide us with information and their abilities to move forward so we can assist them by scaling them up, by helping them start production, if required.
and what's important to note is we also opened up all of our industrial programming, the strategic innovation fund, for example, innovation Canada, so we have the programming and money in place.
We have industry that's willing to step up and this is going to complement the work done by Mr. and which is working closely with the Minister of health.



**Reporter**:

and we're hearing obviously from the other ministers that there is no shortage right now of equipment or of tests.
So are we going to be expanding the criteria of the tests.
We're hearing people showing symptoms but still refused access to a curve.
How can we flatten the curve if we're not testing everybody.



I think, first of all, I want to thank the Minister of procurement and the Minister of innovation for their hard work on this.
This is a massive piece of work to make sure that we're ready for surges that are coming and to continually replenish our ability to provide those services to provinces and territories.
So and the piece that Minister Bains has talked about is the ability to meet anticipated needs.
This is a global crisis.
I'll remind people that things we're searching for and purchasing, it is taking an enormous amount of energy and effort to get those items because every other country in the world that is preparing like ours trying to get those items, too.
I think two of the testing strategy, that is also evolving based on our own epidemiology, based on our own science and research and based on our own capacity to access tests so I'll turn it to Dr. Tam to speak a little bit about how we're doing now in terms of our testing strategy and how we're perceiving that might evolve into the future.



Yes.
I think we can appreciate a lot of people of various mild symptoms and I think the key aspect of the strategy, across Canada and er thees and experts is first of all [inaudible] don't need to be tested.
But all the mildly symptomatic people, you have to prioritize the key individuals that must be tested and these are laid out in specific laboratory testing strategies.
For example, if you have a symptomatic health care worker and it doesn't matter if they're traveled or not traveled, they have to be tested because the first thing you have to avoid is this virus getting into [inaudible] settings.
You have to prioritize those living in assisted living or nursing homes and prioritize hospitalized patients whether they've traveled or not.
That is a key aspect because that where you'll detect if you have spread that is not related to travel, for instance.
That is your biggest strategy to define one of those cases.
and certainly people who are symptomatic who live in certain communities that may have a more specific need for the test, such as people living in the north or people who live in certain first nations Inuit or mÉtis communities where you absolutely want to be certain that they're not being impacted by the virus or that you need to contain it really, really fast.
So public health, this is normal for public health.
You don't just go and test everybody with everything.
You have to be actually strategic about it because you need public health nurses to investigate people as well.
It's not just a matter of a test.
Also, I think evolving is our public health initiative.
If we're asking everybody to stay at home for 14 days, that is the actual public health action.
Further, laboratory testing does not result in a change in their strategy.
You're still going to be staying put at home for 14 days, regardless.
But we are also reviewing the science of that strategy.
So, right now, for example, if you have an onset of symptoms, there's international studies reviewing when can that person go out if they didn't have a test, right? so those are the types of strategies we're looking at right now.



and adjust might add that, as we proceed in the -- in Canada's epidemic, we're doing two things at once, which is challenging because the science is really not there yet.
But one thing we're doing, obly, is preparing our population for a potential surge and trying to flatten the curve so the immediate actions.
and the second thing is carefully reviewing the science and the evidence to figure out how we get out of this situation.
and that isn't something that only Canada is doing.
That is what the entire world is doing.
This morning in another interview, I explained that, you know, social distancing is the best thing we have so far.
But there is a ton of work happening with Canadian researchers and scientist as well as inter nation researchers and scientists to figure out what strategy, whether it's testing or many people are online reading about this right now, whether it's blood testing, whether it's a combination of social distancing and further analysis of people's, you know, situation -- health situation.
Whether it is a. I., but we have our eye on how we get out of this situation.
But the science is not clear yet.
As I evolves, we'll have more and more answers for Canadians.



**Reporter**:





**Interpreter**:

Good afternoon.
With what's being announced today for industry, are we talking about a war effort? well, today there's been an excellent industrial policy and supply policy put in place that has been focused on prevention of coronavirus.
The primary aim is to increase stocks of medical and pro eke thieve equipment that we will likely need over the next few weeks to support provinces.
The second advantage is to scale up industrial capacity here at home and the third is to ensure that the procurement capacity on the part of the federal government is firmly in place to help provinces and er thees manage this crisis and I would like to point out that three of the businesses have been assigned to that agreement with the Canadian government and one of them is medic om located in Montreal.
It's red cross neighed its protective equipment production capacity and disinfectant and also diagnostic tools and follow-uple toos, monitoring tools for the city.
So we are very grateful to these canadian businesses that will be focusing all the industrial [inaudible] the canadian government on this virus and especially the efforts in Quebec and montreal.
I would just like to add is that we're fortunate in Canada because we have a very strong manufacturing sector that is very important elements in our national response and I'm very proud of our scientists, our researchers our business people who have really really stepped up. They're willing to work together in this national effort and I would just like to also say that we spoke about this issue on Wednesday during My call with all the premiers and all of them are very, very committed to this effort.
It is really a Canada wide effort, thank you.
is there a focus to look at masks or --



Yes, it resembles a war effort because the Canadian government is focusing its industrial production efforts and supply efforts on the virus and that being said the equipment that is going to be rolled out more quickly is -- will follow the directives of the public health agency obviously in collaboration with thee these.
There is a level of cooperation that is extraordinary between the federal government and the provinces and territories and the good news is that with the scaled up focus on industrial production capacity, then provinces and territories will be able to take care of their own.
Navy, would you like to add something? yes, I agree with My colleague.
It is so important to have a strategy across the sector and that is why I'm here today to announce the strategy.
and it will help the health care sector.
That is our priority and that is why we AR going to continue to work with all businesses across Canada and we will amass the equipment that is necessary.
I understand this is a very serious and complicated situation right now.
But a great many businesses want to participate.
They want to especially the up. and that is why we announced this very clear strategy for all sectors, for all businesses with a single goal to help the health care sector.
Thank you.
Telephone, telephone.
In french.



Thank you.
Thank you, Merci.
Please press star one if you have a question.
 first question is from the Toronto star". please go ahead.
 please go ahead.



**Reporter**:

Can you hear me? can you hear me?



Yes, I can.



**Reporter**:

Ok. Yeah.
Just going back to that question on what supplies we need.
Can you tell us, based on what we have right now and this new industrial strategy, what products or what items are in most urgent need right now?



Navy, do you want to start?



Surement . I want to reiterate what was said before.
To say that we are taking every measure possible to be prepared, to make sure that we are over prepared as My colleague said.
and to understand clearly the importance of taking advantage of our strong industrial base.
There's many, many companies that have put up their hands, that have indicated that they want to be supportive, that want to retool their production facilities.
and so we're identifying clearly the needs around masks and ventilators and gowns, hand sanitizers, etc.
So what we're saying is we'd rather be in a position where we have the ability, because as My colleague patty haj, the u -- hajdu said that there is global demand and pressure to ramp up here in Canada.
That is designed with one clear purpose, to make sure that we protect Canadians and we protect front line health care workers.
That is what this strategy is about to complement and build on the work that is done by procurement Canada and it's based on the need that are being put forward by the provinces and territories in conjunction with the public health agency of Canada.



I think Anita has something to add, too.



Exactly, Navy.
The most important point there is that these are complimentary strategies.
We are working together to ensure that we are leveraging our relationship with existing suppliers and we're also working additional supply chains and developing new supply chains.
Because we know that this is an era of global demand and we want to be ready.
We are anticipating future needs and we are working very hard to ensure that Canadians are safe.



and just as a follow-up on that, I know there's been a lot of talk about ventilators.
Can you guys tell us how many ventilators we actually have in all the provinces ander territories and how many additional ones have been ordered?



Actually, we can't give you that level of precision right now.
We can tell you that the provinces and territories are working very, very diligently to make sure that they have what they need and continuely communicate with us what their current capacity is and what their current need might be, based on any surge activity.
This is a complicated question with a complicated answer.
We actually have statistical and epidemiological modelers based on the current expression of illness in our country where we might anticipate surge and how we might flat en the curve in that area.
What additional maefshes we might take to flat en that curve.
So the question seems similarly . in fact, I would say it's not as simple as it sounds.
Right now we have what we need for the current situation based on the modeling as we go forward.
There is also an agreement amongst provinces and territories that are harder to produce or quite substantial like ventilators in a way that meets the surge, depending on where it is in the country.
So those conversations are what reaffirm for me that we are in a good position as a country, to be able to meet those anticipated surges.
[please stand by]-- we place an order for 550ventilators and that might change and evolve and we'retrying to get secure contracts as we speak.
That's without waiting for the specific numbers that provinces are currently needing right now.
But that's just as a preemptive.
and I want to say that we have mutual aid agreement between the provinces and territories.
We have something called an operational framework for mutualaid.
So if in areas of the countrythey're impacted more thanothers, and you don't just need the ventilators but you may need the people who operate them.
So there are mechanisms that exist is this that be needed.



and navdeep has something toadd.



To build on what Dr. Tam said and the work by our procurementteam, one of the companies that we identified today is actually in the business of buildingventilators.
and they have the ability to scale up. and we're trying to identify the companies like this that have the ability to scale up on aging forward basis to deal with future needs as described by mycolleagues.
So it is as mentioned before strategy that speaks to strong procurement practices based on the current needs and the potential future needs.
and also to build up ourcapacity.
and that's what we're announcingtoday.
This situation is fluid.
and the numbers will evolve andchange.
But we're doing everything that we possible we can to make sure that we have more and not less.



Thank you.
The next question [speakingfrench]please go ahead.


---

**Question**:

[speakingfrench](voice of translator): goodafternoon, Mr. Duclos, firstquestion to you.
Can you confirm what ministerblair said that the closing ofthe roxham road for migrants isonly temporary and will go backto business as usual once theborder has reopened? and you also said that you aretaking responsibility for themigrants.
Can you tell us how many peopleare already in Canada who havebeen taken into custody byottawa and where are they?



**[Speaking French](Voice of Translator)**:

Thankyou.
I'm just going to sum up the announcement of Minister blairand I would like to thank him once again for his hard work on this issue.
and so since this morning, reciprocal arrangement is reached with the United States government which means that asylum seekers who come to irregular points of entry are redirected back to the United states.
and that will be effective tonight at midnight.
Just like the other measures that we announced earlier this week regarding the travel of passengers across the border fornon-essential travel.
That being said, we have alsoannounced earlier this week thatthis is a crisis with no time todiscuss jurisdictional matters.
This response to this crisiscalls for extraordinary measuresand that is why the federalgovernment is assumingresponsibility for isolating allasylum seekers who have comethrough irregular channels andwho have not respected the 14days of isolation.
That is what we have announcedtoday.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): I'd like to add as mall detail from the deputy prime Minister.



Minister Blair helped us with the details on this and the announcement made yesterday, the federal government has taken responsibility for finding apace for asylum seekers to be placed in isolation and socanada has taken responsibility for that.
For finding a place for them.
Thank you, and thank you, bill.



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Last question on the telephone.

---

**Question**:

Thank you.
My first question is to ministerblair and Dr. Tam.
I'm wondering on the migrant --on the refusal -- not migrantworkers.
On the refusal to allow irregular asylum seekers intocanada, what changed? and what evidence is there to suggest that this population ISS higher health risk?



There is no evidence thatthey're a higher health risk but we have recognized thatnon-essential traveller comingacross the border do represent arisk.
We have taken steps that we putin place across the entireborder to restrict non-essentialtraveller coming in. We also recognize the importanceof ensuring that should theycome across, if people do comeacross that border, that theyare subject to a period of 14days of self-isolation.
Accommodating and managing thatis a difficult challenge, working closely with the quÉbecgovernment on this issue whonormally accommodates these.
and as a result, as part of alarge group of initiatives andmeasures that we have put inplace with our allies in the United states, we have agreedreciprocally, that any personcoming across the border will bedirected back to the countryfrom which they originated.
So coming into Canada from the United states or from the United States into Canada we'll simplydirect them back to curtail thatirregular migration, that isdifficult to ensure the safetyof Canadians.
It's a larger sweep of measuresthat are put in place to havebetter control of non-essentialpassage of that border.
and this is a challenge tomanage and regulate.
and to address that challenge inthese extraordinarycircumstances we have agreedthis is the appropriate measureto put in place.

---

**Question**:

Okay, and My second question is also to Dr. Tam and to Minister Freeland.
Should Canadian athletes travel to japan for the Olympics? even if the Olympics go ahead.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Dr. Tam do you want to start?



I think that our recommendation is to avoid allnon-essential travel.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

and we believe in following the advice of our experts here incanada and so let me just echodr.
Tam and say that canadiansshould avoid all non-essentialtravel.
We have been very clear aboutthat.
and that is for the health ofthe potential travellers and forthe health of all Canadians whenyou come back home.



I would also add that given the global situation and how quickly things evolve there'sdisruption in air travel and with border measures so it'svery hard to predict what is going to happen right now globally from a variety of different prospectives.
and the safest thing forcanadians to do right now in terms of international travel is to stay home.



Okay, we'll go back on thephone.



From lone Gardner, politico.

---

**Question**:

Thank you for taking My question.
So there's no specific mention in the United States guidance on the partial border closure about things like compassionatetravel, which has been a term that has been put out in the last couple days.
There are some specific examples of who is allowed to cross forwork, but it leaves a question as to how much will this be left to the border agents' discretion to determine if someone'sbusiness reason is actually, quote/unquote, reasonable?



I'll begin the answer to thatquestion.
Our officials on both sides of the border have been working closely to make sure thatthere's a consistency in the way in which these measures will beimplemented, but, at the sametime, we recognize that there'sexceptional and extraordinary circumstances and there's an expectation that border officer swill have the appropriate discretion in determining in those exceptional extraordinary circumstances if the travel is, in fact, essential.
What we are all united in in attempting to do which is to discourage that travel that is not essential.
Tourist activities or recreational activities.
We recognize the importance of workers getting to important jobs and ensuring that we maintain the supply of goods that compromise the vital trade and supply chains that cross our borders each and every day.
and at the same time we recognize that there will be extraordinary circumstances.
and so our expectation is that extraordinary matters will be dealt with in extraordinary ways.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

and I would add to use the trade metaphor that this is about negative list approach rather than a positive list approach.
So we actually have made a real point in saying actually what we are restricting is non-essentialtravel.
and we specified for tourists orrecreational purposes.
and that is clear and specificbecause we understand that thecanada-United States border relationshipis so deep, so interconnectedthat there are communities likepoint roberts in the United States for whom daily life doesrequire crossing the border.
and for whom crossing the borderis as much a part of what theydo every day as to what one ofus don't flif in one of thosecommunicate -- live in thosecommunities.
and it's literally going to thegrocery store and for the localfire department to function, people have to go back and forthacross the border.
So I really want to be clear andwe had very clear conversationsstarting with the president andthe Prime Minister, me and thevice president, I spoke tosecretary pompeo and bill hasbeen talking to the homelandsecurity secretary a lot overthe past few days.
Both of our countries reallyunderstand how important thatborder and that borderrelationship is above all fortrade.
and trade that is essential, essential for our communities toactually survive, particularlyin this period that people havebeen talking about making surethat our grocery stores havefood.
Making sure that medicals goback and forth across theborder.
But even beyond the tradingrelationship there are a lot ofpeople whose lives reallyrequire going back and forthacross the border and that willnot be impeded.
What we are doing is saying thatthere are some activities whichare clearly non-essential.
If you are american, we loveamerican tourists, but now isnot the time to go to whistler.
If you are canadian, now is notthe time -- hang on -- excuseme, this is actually a reallyimportant issue that a lot ofcanadians, especially those wholive along the border reallycare about and we had a questionsaying that people are notentirely clear so I'm going tofinish My sentence, okay? so non-essential travel isrestricted and that is it.

---

**Question**:

and a quickfollow-up. is there any interest in --among the cabinet in what is nowa temporary move on turning backirregular migrants.
is there an interest in seeingthat made permanent in thefuture once this pandemic isbehind us?



I'll begin in the answer tothat.
We are dealing with extraordinary circumstancestoday.
and our focus is on keepingcanadians safe and we have taken and we'll to be to take the necessary measures to effect that purpose of keeping peoplesafe.
We take -- we have taken what we believe to be a responsible measure in a reciprocal way wit hour allies in the United States -- both of us share concern for the safety of ourcitizens.
That's where our focus is today.
and we have a focus on the need to keep people safe and that'swhy we're doing it.



Okay, one more for the phone.

---

**Question**:

Thank you, the nextquestion... (voice oftranslator): please go ahead.

---

**Question**:

Good afternoon, Mr. Blair.
[end of translation]can you hear me?



Yes, yes he can.



I didn't turn My microphoneon, Marie, I apologise.

---

**Question**:

Because I used my phone when I asked a question to the Prime Minister so I wasn'tsure.
I wanted to ask you a little more about the migrants change that you guys are bringing forward today.
You mentioned that there would be limited exceptions to the ones that would be turned back at the border.
I'd like to know what those are.
and I'd like to you elaborate on why you're deciding this now given that yesterday you were planning to put them in isolation in Canada and I wonder what changed and I guess thati'll get a follow-up afterwards, thank you.



For example, an unaccompaniedminor, with the americannationality, for example, would be an exception, and who is claiming asylum from the United States.
and so, you know, we acknowledge that those limited exception sexist and we are prepared to deal appropriately with them.
But at the same time, I believe that the measures that we'veannounced today will be effective in deterring people from coming.
I think that there's a growingacknowledgement.
I'll tell you, for example, yesterday that we have averaged about 45 to 50 people coming each day and yesterday the number was 17. So I think that people are recognising that this is not the time to be going to the border and crossing over and engaging in that behaviour because it presents a risk to them and toothers.
We believe that these measure swill be effective.
If you asked, you know, why it took so long, quite frankly, this was an extraordinarily rapid discussion that took place between our government.
and as the deputy prime minister has indicated, there have been very important but incredibly collaborative discussions taking place in a number of different levels within our government.
and I would take the opportunity if I may to acknowledge the extraordinary work of our officials who have been working through the details and the important parts of implementation that made thiseffective.
But there has been an extraordinary collaboration between our two countries.
and it is important to recognize that many people just say, well, why don't you just do this and act unilaterally and just put it in place.
I think that demonstrates profound lack of understanding of how things work between two sovereign nations.
It is important that we worktogether.
We have done that.
and I will tell you that the level of cooperation and the speed with which this has been achieved is unprecedented.
and, frankly, only a week ago would have suggested that it wasinconceivable, and yet it's beendone.
The work happened.
and we've come to this.
and it's the right thing to do. and we're moving as quickly as possible because we're all motivated to keep people safe.

---

**Question**:

Yeah, actually my question wasn't why it took solong.
My question was why now give gin for that years now your government has refused to turn people back at the border despite multiple calls from the opposition or from other groups.
So I'm wondering why all of sudden you do feel comfortable and that it's the right decision to turn these people back? and then My follow-up wasconcerning the temporaryresidents in Canada.
We were told that a few days agothat people with work permits orstudent permits would be allowedto come back to Canada, despitethe closing of the border.
But they're not being allowed tocome in. For example, at the trudeauairport in montrÉal. So can you say when you expectsome clarity on this idea thatpeople should be able to come inbut they are being refused, despite being told they couldcome in?



Again, Marie, judgment is exercised on the essential nature of that travel.
and, quite frankly, we're doing our very best to encourage all international travel, internationally and across thetransborder with the United States.
and so, again, discretion and judgment is being exercised in those cases.
We wanted to assure those peoplewho, for example, were already here on student visas, forexample, would be assured they would be able to continue to dothat.
At the same time, we also recognize in some of those circumstances with studentvisas, certainly with work visa sand absolutely for temporary foreign workers that we recognize the essential nature of that work.
and so in respect of the essential nature of that work it will be, of course, exempted from the restrictions that we have put in place.



**The Hon. Chyrstia Freeland**:

Yeah and let me just add some further clarity there.
What Minister garneau said earlier this week is the case that valid work and student visas to come to Canada will be respected at the canadianborder, at the Canada-United States border, and at internationalborders.
and that includes temporaryforeign workers.
Those people, of course, willneed to self-isolate for 14days, like everyone coming backto Canada.
As for the uncertainty at theborder around the rules, I thinkthat all of us need to have alittle bit of patience andunderstanding about the currentsituation.
These are extraordinary times.
Our government across the wholeof government is acting at apace which would be neitherpossible nor advisable inordinary times.
We're doing things that wouldnormally take three to sixmonths in two or three days.
and that is absolutely rightbecause the situation demandsit.
But what it does mean is thatvery often -- today we're in asituation where we need to makean announcement and make clearto Canadians what we are goingto do. and to fill in the detailsafterwards.
and what that does mean is thatthe people whose job it is toimplement when it comes to thedetails, it takes a little bitof time for the preciseinformation to get to everyone.
and, you know, in ordinary timesthat is not how we wouldoperate.
But I think that Canadians --you know, I am very confidentthat that's what we need to dotoday.
and I'm actually reallyconfident that Canadians aresmart and they understand, youknow, as Dr. Tam said to us -- ithink that it was on Tuesday, st. Patrick's day, right -- tospeed over perfection.
That has become a real motto forus, because we understand thatthis is a global pandemic.
So we need to act with agilityand we are.
and I would like to apologise toall Canadians that it does meanthat sometimes every singledetail -- not sometimes -- itmeans pretty much that everysingle detail is not going to beworked out in advance.
But I think that people willagree that it's better to actwith speed than to wait for theperfection which could mooenthat our country's -- could meanthat our country's response tothis global pandemic would bedelayed with truly fatalconsequences.



Okay, we have gone over quit ea bit.
So one more question from theroom.
Mike from global and one last question on the phone.

---

**Question**:

Okay, there's some centres that are going to open up -- sorry -- in Canada.
Can you tell me what these arefor? are they going to be frontlineplaces where people go? or is it -- front line places are going to handle the overflow for places like hospitals that can'thandle it. What is the role of these assessment centres?



I'll let you take that.



Yes, of course, that's in the purview of the local and the provincial jurisdictions, but for the most part these are specifically set up to assess people with potentially who havecovid-19.

---

**Question**:

and the other question is -- so I've heard that it takes -- we have aback log on testing so when you get the test it takes about four days to get results.
If that's the case we're waiting for people to get symptomatic and they get the test and then they have to wait four days until they get results back.
At that point what is the point of the testing? because we would know in four days whether someone is sick ornot.



Well, the point of the testing is to confirm whether or not they have COVID-19 and to do the contact tracing.
So first of all let me say on the testing time it varies fromprovince-to-province --



[indiscernible]



Go ahead, do you have anaverage?



Well, I can talk to our la band obviously different laboratories and ours is different because they have to ship it to us on like a day onaverage.
and there's other reasons that some things might not reach us within that kind of timeframe.
But as soon as we get it, it would be like a day, with thetransportation.
and I think that the most important thing is that people must self-isolate immediatelyand that's the key.



To your question that's the most important part.
Whenever anyone is symptomatic they should be self-isolating athome and that's the importantpart.
So the test doesn't clear themor not, it's not about actuallya clear at this point, it'sabout, you know, trying toconfirm if they have it and thenallowing public health to do thehard work of the contacttracing.
Who have they been near? and were they exposed tosomebody else and how did thatcase come about? that's how you work on thecontainment piece and it makessure that you contain the spreadwithin that community or withinthat particular setting.
and all of that data folds upinto the provincial data whichthen lands at the federaldatabase which allows us tounderstand the modeling so muchbetter about where we're seeingpotential sparks.
If you remember those earlyconversations about the sparkscoming from china.
Now we're trying to do the samething in Canada.
We're trying to figure out whereis the fire burning and whereare those sparks going.
So that we can actually bettercontain and hopefully defeat thespread across the country.



Thank you, Minister.
One last question on the phone.



**[Speaking French](Voice of Translator)**:

Louisduvois, global Canada, go ahead.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): good afternoon, have a question with the asylum seekers who are crossing at the irregular point of entry formr.
Duclos.
What happens to asylum seekers returned to the same United States authorities, will they bedetained? will they be released? what is their lot? thank you.



I will -- I will attempt to answer this first in English and then turn to My friend to answer in french, if I may.
Under the overwhelming majority of circumstances, they will not be detained.
They'll simply be returned back to the United States or, forexample, if they come fromcanada and they are returned to us they would not be detained.
There are very, very limitedexceptions.
For example, if there was an issue of serious criminality that had to be addressed, then that might result in a person'sdetention.
But just as it relates to the border and immigration matters, there would be no detention.

---

**Question**:

(voice ofdetention.



So in the vast majority of cases they'll return to the United states if they're coming from Canada and vice versa because of this reciprocalarrangement.
and in very, very rareexceptions, for example, violence or serious criminality, they could be detained but they should be very, very rare cases.
Thank you.

---

**Question**:

(voice oftranslator): question, are there tools being put in place to ensure that people are not trying to cross elsewhere thanroxham road? are they patrolling in other places across the area to ensure that the border is sealed?



**(Voice of Translator)**:

Answer.
This is the reciprocalarrangement.
So no asylum seeker should be crossing at irregular points of entry in either direction.
and, therefore, both of our governments are applying the required measures.
Thank you.



That is Canada's chief public health officer and ministers answers questions on a variety of measures that the government announced today and we'll try to break down the things that you need to know before we let yougo.
and for had upon on that I bring in David Cochrane.
Canada tries to secure a certain supply of medical equipment and then find ways to produce it here in this country?



**Reporter**:

There's an urgent need on the front lines to have medical supplies.
We have seen today the system that Canada is going to follow to deal with this.
Patty hajdu and Theresa Tam will look at the need in conjunction with the provinces, a need for the procurement Minister to buy what is available and navdeepbains will help the industrial sector to ramp up to create domestic supply.
So some numbers today.
Dr. Tam is telling us they preemptively ordered 550ventilators and they're working to get more.
and saying they have secured11.3 million n95 masks and the provinces said they need seven million and they have 11 million so the goal is to beoverprepared.
and navdeep Bains announcingthey'll take the innovation fauns in the country and focusing on the fight for COVID-19 and securing contracts with threecompanies.
One is in montrÉal, to start manufacturing personal protective equipment like n95masks.
and one in ottawa for asmall-scale portable device todo tests and portably withinairports and to get results in30 minutes.
and thornhill medical that makesventilators and they'll scale upand produce more ventilatorrors.
and auto parts manufacturers, welook them to build, and it's asmaller scale manufacturers thatsupply things that are going toretool to help to do this.
In addition to as the ministersaid 5, 800 submissions fromother companies looking to scaleup and to adapt what they do ina way to supply necessarymedical equipment into thehealth care system.
So this shows the urgent needand the requirement and theanticipated long-term need andrequirement, rosie, becauseramping up a new production lineis not something that happensovernight.
So the short-term needs, and thelong-term needs and navdeepbains is on that in conjunctionwith the health Minister and thepublic health agency of Canada, because the reality is, rosie, the global supply chain is goingto tighten if not Dr. up. and the european union has putrestrictions on the export ofcore medical equipment andthailand has done that andprobably only a matter of timefor the United States to dosomething like that.
So to keep the country wholethey need to mobilize in thisdirection and that is whatyou're seeing.
a war-time footing in a lot ofways, to beat this viral enemyfrom Canada's industrialit toput the supplies into thefrontline health services thatare so badly needed.



**Rosemary**:

Good job breaking down the way that it waspresented.
Let me highlight a couple other things that came out of that press conference.
a reminder to Canadians that the border closes for allnon-essential travel as of 11:59tonight.
That will now happen at thecanada-United States border and themexico-United States border and thegovernment announcing today thatthey are also -- those crossingat irregular points of entrylike roxham road in quÉbec arenow directed back to the United States.
and that also is a significantshift in the government policythat they say that istemporarily.
All of these temporary borderclosures are reviewed after 30days to see if they need to beextended.
a couple other points to leaveyou with.
and Dr. Theresa tam said there'sbeen 66, 000 tests in thiscountry and 10, 000 yesterdayalone.
So we are seeing more testing.
She gave a vrgz explanation asto why not everyone is beingtested.
We know that the first planerepatriating Canadians frommorocco is going to return thisweekend and the government islooking at morocco and peru astwo areas of focus.
If you know a canadian strandedin one of those countries andthe government is also lookingat school groups that may bestuck in countries overseas.
and, finally, let me leave youwith a staggering number thatthe Prime Minister gave us thismorning around those who havealready looked for somefinancial aid, employmentinsurance, or other things fromthe government.
That the Prime Minister tellingcanadian 500, 000 tests have gonein already, and we expect it togo up in the days and the weeksahead as the economy struggleswith this public health crisis.
